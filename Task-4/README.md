# Decision Tree Classifier model on the IRIS Dataset
In this task i have created a Decision Tree Classifier model which would predict the IRIS-species on the basis of the length and width of the petals and sepals.
I used Boxplot, Heatmap & Confusion Matrix for the visualization of data.
# These are some screenshots of my ML model
